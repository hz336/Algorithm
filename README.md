- In machine learning, a “kernel” is usually used to refer to the kernel trick, a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem. It entails transforming linearly inseparable data like to linearly separable ones. The kernel function is what is applied on each data instance to map the original non-linear observations into a higher-dimensional space in which they become separable.
