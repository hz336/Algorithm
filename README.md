there is a standard cable used to connect monitor
that's one

another one you need to buy a vga cable
and a converter to convert vga to usb
there is vga outlet on the monitor
and plenty of usb on the desktop

so in theory, you could connect many more monitors
the display quality is slightly worse, but almost non-distinguishable
