10 key takeaways from AM's first town hall with CEO George Gatch: 

1) We're at an inflection point in the industry. Asset managers face numerous challenges.
"There's incredible competition, structural change, margin pressure, fee pressure and regulatory intensity like never before in the industry — and J.P. Morgan Asset Management is facing many of these same challenges.

"There's overcapacity in the industry, and we're likely to go through several more years of intense competitive and pricing pressure." 

2) But asset management is a growth industry. And there's a tidal wave of assets coming.
"There will be a tidal wave of assets that come into the asset management industry over the next five years. Global assets under management are forecasted to grow 6% per annum for the industry — that's on top of the $90 trillion of unmanaged assets currently held by individuals and institutions. If we do a good job, it's likely many of those assets are going to come to us."

3) Industry consolidation is going to accelerate.
"We've seen consolidation in the industry over the last decade, but it's going to accelerate. The winners are going to take a significant amount of share and scale-players like J.P. Morgan Asset Management are going to reap the benefits.

"We are going to grow and thrive. There isn't any other firm that has the depth, the scope and the quality of investment capabilities that we have to offer clients. And clients need what we have to offer now more than ever."

4) We've got great momentum and record net flows. But revenues are flat.
"Our AUM is now $1.9 trillion and we're well on our way to $2.0 trillion. Our AUM has grown 6% per annum over the last five years. And through September, we've had $118 billion in long-term and liquidity flows — we'll end the year with record net flows.

"But despite almost every asset class and every market around the world being up, our revenues are flat. It's evidence of the dramatic, structural changes taking place in the asset management space and how these trends are impacting our business financially.

"Compared to our biggest competitors and other publicly traded firms, these are actually pretty good results. But on an absolute basis, this isn't anywhere close to where we want to be."

5) The way forward: We'll continue our "Simplify for Growth" strategy. 
"Under Chris Willcox's leadership, we made significant and substantial progress to simplify our business for growth. We closed a quarter of our product line. We exited markets, closed or consolidated offices, managed expenses aggressively, and began focusing our resources on areas that have the biggest impact for our clients. But we have more work to do."

6) We're still too complex.
"We've got too many investment strategies — about twice as many as our peer competitors. 20% of our strategies produce 80% of our revenues. We need a bar-bell approach: large/scaleable products on one end, and niche/innovative products on the other. We must work to reduce the 'belly' in the middle."

7) We're always going to simplify, but now we get to focus heavily on growth.  
"We're investing heavily in growth products that will have a bigger impact for our clients — ETFs, digital, alternatives — and in growth regions, like China.

"Becoming a 51% owner of China International Fund Management (CIFM) is an extraordinary milestone and we'll look back at this as one of the most important steps taken in the globalization of our firm."

8) Innovation is fundamental to how we do business.
"We cannot stop innovating. We have to continually drive innovation and there are a couple of things under way to help us do that. One is the MIT Innovation Lab. We're the asset management sponsor for the lab and this gives us access to the best academic thinking around innovation. We'll be trying some other things as well to harness the best ideas from everyone here because we know our business better than anyone else."

9) The opportunity to gain market share is huge.
"We have a world-class business — and major positions in every asset class around the world. Yet we have relatively low market share in almost every one of our businesses and asset classes. Of all the hundreds of things we offer, the vast majority of our clients are using us for just one thing. Imagine the potential if all of our clients became super-users and invested across all of our products."

10) It's important to remember our purpose.
"Managing money for other people is the heart and soul of what we do. Strong investment performance is critical to our success. But it's not just about alpha. It's about purpose. Asset managers provide capital to fund innovators and entrepreneurs. We help insurance companies produce profits so they can pay claims. We help institutions fund their pension liabilities so they can pay beneficiaries to live comfortably in retirement. We help individuals meet the most important financial objectives in their lives, like preparing for retirement and paying for college.

"What we do is really important and I fundamentally believe in it, and in our ability to do it better than most. This is one extraordinary franchise and I have no doubt that the best is yet to come."
