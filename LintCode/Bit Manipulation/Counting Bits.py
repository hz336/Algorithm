"""
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and
return them as an array.

Example
Given num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Challenge
It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).

Time complexity: O(n)
