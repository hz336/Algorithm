"""
Give an integer arrayï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array.

An increasing continuous subsequence:

Can be from right to left or from left to right.
Indices of the integers in the subsequence should be continuous.

Example
For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.

For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.
